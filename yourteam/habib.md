# Bio
Hey, my name is Habib Jinadu, and I'm a 4th year Electrical Engineering Student.This
is my first Hackathon and I entered the Hackathon becuase I think it Engg Competitions are cool. I also entered because I get extra ENSF 409 marks.

A little bit about me: I was born in Nigeria and I transferred into Electrical Engineering because electronics can enable awesome and useful technology (_like the screen on which you are reading this bio_).

I also enjoy playing basketball and soccer with others. (_I hope I am able to safely do that again sometime soon_)

I have made a couple of coding projects on Git Hub, one that I am proud of is a 2D pathfinding algorithm you can find here: [A* Path Finding Algorithm Demo](https://github.com/habibjinadu/2DPathFinding)
